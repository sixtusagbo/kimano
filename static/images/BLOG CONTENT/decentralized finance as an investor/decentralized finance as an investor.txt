Decentralized finance, also known as DeFi, is a financial system that operates on a decentralized blockchain network, rather than through traditional financial institutions such as banks. It seeks to create a more open, transparent, and accessible financial system that is not reliant on centralized intermediaries.

In DeFi, financial applications are built on top of blockchain networks such as Ethereum. These applications are referred to as "smart contracts" and they are programmed to execute transactions automatically when certain conditions are met. This allows for the creation of financial products and services that can be accessed and used by anyone with an internet connection, without the need for a middleman.

One of the most popular use cases for DeFi is lending and borrowing. Through DeFi platforms, users can lend and borrow cryptocurrency without the need for a traditional bank. Instead, they can use smart contracts to set terms and conditions, such as interest rates and repayment schedules, and execute transactions automatically.

Another popular use case for DeFi is decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a centralized exchange. DEXs use smart contracts to execute trades automatically, without the need for a middleman to match buyers and sellers.

DeFi also offers other financial products and services, such as insurance, prediction markets, and stablecoins. These products and services are built on top of blockchain networks and use smart contracts to execute transactions automatically, without the need for intermediaries.

Overall, DeFi seeks to create a more open and accessible financial system that is not reliant on traditional financial institutions. By using blockchain technology and smart contracts, it allows for the creation of financial products and services that are more transparent, efficient, and accessible to a wider range of people.
